    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am an initiator, a big-picture thinker, a self-starter, and a motivator.
      I'm known for my high energy and positive outlook, and I thrive working
      with people! Having worked closely with students of all different
      backgrounds and abilities for years, I've fallen in love with the world of
      higher education. I excel at people-oriented problem-solving - providing
      practical and personalized solutions to help individuals and teams achieve
      their goals. I now live in the world of Slate by Technolutions, where I've
      discovered an incredibly supportive community and a powerful tool to
      enhance the accessibility of higher education for both students and staff.
      While I have always loved technology - I'm a bit project management
      software nerd - I have discovered my niche as a Slate CRM developer. It
      allows me to combine my love for tech with a deep understanding of the
      on-the-ground needs of students and educators. In my spare time, I climb,
      run, mountain bike, cycle, backpack, car camp, hop on cheap flights to
      random destinations, and generally keep myself entertained.
