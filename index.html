      <p>
        I am an initiator, a big-picture thinker, a self-starter, and a
        motivator. I'm known for my high energy and positive outlook, and I
        thrive working with people! Having worked closely with students of all
        different backgrounds and abilities for years, I've fallen in love with
        the world of higher education. I excel at people-oriented
        problem-solving - providing practical and personalized solutions to help
        individuals and teams achieve their goals. I now live in the world of
        Slate by Technolutions, where I've discovered an incredibly supportive
        community and a powerful tool to enhance the accessibility of higher
        education for both students and staff. While I have always loved
        technology - I'm a bit project management software nerd - I have
        discovered my niche as a Slate CRM developer. It allows me to combine my
        love for tech with a deep understanding of the on-the-ground needs of
        students and educators. In my spare time, I climb, run, mountain bike,
        cycle, backpack, car camp, hop on cheap flights to random destinations,
        and generally keep myself entertained.
